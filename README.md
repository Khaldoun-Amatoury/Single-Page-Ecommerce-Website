 ## Project Overview
This project is a simple e-commerce application built using React. It features a header, a shop section that displays a list of products, and a shopping cart context provider. The products are hardcoded in the `DUMMY_PRODUCTS` array, but in a real-world application, they would typically be fetched from a database or an API.

## Getting Started
To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`.
3. Start the development server by running `npm run dev`.
